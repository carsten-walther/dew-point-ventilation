# Dew Point Ventilation

## How it works

The two DHT22 sensors determine the temperatures and relative humidity for indoors and outdoors.

The difference in humidity is calculated from the measured values and the relay for deactivating/activating the fan is switched depending on this.

The settings for switching hysteresis, minimum outdoor and indoor temperatures can be made via the LCD menu and the rotary encoder.

The device is configured so that it also works without a WLAN connection or MQTT/Home Assistant API.
